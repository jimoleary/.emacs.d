evil-jumper is an implementation of Vim's jump list which allows
you to jump across buffer boundaries and revive dead buffers if
necessary.  The jump list can also be persisted to a file and
restored between sessions.

Install:

(require 'evil-jumper)

Usage:

Requiring will automatically rebind C-o and C-i.
